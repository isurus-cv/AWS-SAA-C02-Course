## Network Storage

### EFS Architecture

EFS moves the instances closer to a stateless.

EFS is an implementation of NFSv4

EFS Filesystems can be mounted in Linux.

Using Amazon EFS with Microsoft Windowsâ€“based Amazon EC2 instances is not supported.

Media can be shared between many EC2 instances.

This is a private service, access is via mount targets inside a VPC.

You can access from on-premises with VPN or DX so long as access is configured.

#### Elastic File System Explained

EFS runs inside a VPC.
EFS includes POSIX permissions. These are made available via mount targets.

For a fully highly available system you need a mount target for each AZ the
system runs in.

You can use hybrid networking to connect to the same mount targets.

#### EFS Exam Powerup

EFS is Linux Only

Two performance modes, **general purpose** (ideal for latency sensitive use cases, web servers, CDNs, home directories, general file serving when using linux instances) and **max I/O performance** mode (high latency - this is a trade-off) - (ideal for highly paralell applications - big data, media processing, sceintific analysis etc.).

General purpose = default for 99.9% of uses

**Bursting** and **provisioned** throughput modes.
- Bursting mode work like GP2 volumes in EBS. More data you store, you get more throuhput
- Provisioned mode - handles throughput requirements separately from the size. This is like IO1 volumes in EBS

Two storage classes available, **standard** (default, this is used to store frequent access files) and **infrequent access** (lower cost).

Lifecycle policies can move data between EFS (just like S3)
